Hi! My name is Chaitanya Chaturvedi. I live in Kolkata, India. I am 21 years old. I am a recent graduate. I studied BCA Hons. from University of Burdwan. Now I am planning to pursue MCA. I aspire to become a software engineer. My areas of interest range from technology, blogging, poetry, story telling to drawing. I have also been a Microsoft learn student ambassador and codecademy chapter leader at my college. I like learning new technologies, developing websites, creating new arts. Although my motivation to learn any technology is to develop something but i just love the process of it. Because while developing or creating something you are faced with several problems and to solve them makes it even more enjoyable. 
# Always remember - 

> You are not remembered for the product you create, instead you are remembered for the problems you solved while creating it and by creating it. - Chaitanya Chaturvedi 

# My heart says

I like to read, to write, to sing, to code, to laugh, to love, to be loved but the most of it i like, is to make people's live simpler and better. I feel the need to bring about the change from the scattered things at the desk to the lives of people in the organization. I assume my self to be a responsible and trustworthy guy being an employee, a boss, an entrepreneur, a family member as much as i feel being a responsible citizen. At times i do cry, i do become sad but instead of crying at somebody's shoulder i look at myself in the mirror and ask - is it worth it? Do these worth the priceless wrinkles and tears? And eventually i come out as even more stronger individual. Although you may not find me as that perfectionist guy. But you see the only thing i strive for when i wake up from the bed <em>is perfection.</em>
