They say, 
> *schools don't make scholars, neither do the books<br>
For the one who knows love, knows beyond all the truths.*

Being born in the early 2000's, I was always confused about the word love. For me love was the word reserved only for couples and lovebirds. I thought to love someone is to kiss them, hug them, date them, write love letters to them, meet with them secretly or be their partner in everything and all this in the romantic sense. Like as you would expect from all the above mentioned people. 

Having a color TV at home, Like most kids at that time i was also exposed to bollywood movies. And no doubt they were all about love. It was not that people at my home were into romantic movies. But most of the movies that were hit or being broadcasted were about love only or at least a major part of the plot was about love only. So as you might have guessed this is why I had that stereotype about love. And another reason was, love was not a part of discussion at any of the school rhymes, stories, activities, debates, drama, books, etc. It was as if love is a taboo and is only done by as i said couples or lovebirds. At least that is what I could understand back then. I was afraid to ask anyone and so i kept it to myself. You may wonder even if I would have asked will I have understood for anyone who tried to make me understand. Well you certainly make kids understand about brushing teeth, bathing every morning, going to school, so i don't think you would have failed explaining about love considering you yourself have a clear understanding of it. It's not as complex as calculus I guess.

 Anyways, so I thought maybe it's the way it is. I see people always stop me and ask questions about me, my family, my school, sometimes they laugh, sometimes they offer me chocolates, some of them even used to play with me. I enjoyed it all but was it all love? Do they used to love me? Well I don't think so. Because not all of them were girls and again love is always between a boy and a girl only. Time went and people changed, so does my view about the world. I got promoted to 6th standard. And by then i learnt a lot of things. But the only thing that didn't change was my view on love. I still felt the same thing about love as I used to earlier. 

Being a good student, I got to be the monitor of my class. So I was the one responsible for answering about all the shouting and mischief going on in my class. It was all good until one day our class teacher left the school and we got a new one. We heard she will take the same subject that is English and in the same period, the first period. So I was standing before the blackboard with a chalk in my hand. I had the task of writing names of students on the blackboard in case they shouted or did any mischief. But being a backbencher myself I was never bothered by any. I was talking to one of my friends. Suddenly a wonderful fragrance came to my nose. I said "wow smells like Jasmine". Suddenly the smell got even stronger and someone behind me asked "Is it the sixth standard?". I turned back and I saw a lady. The only word I uttered while looking at her was "amazing". She was wearing a pink silk salwar suit with dark pink dupatta, her hairs were straight hanging up till her back. She had a slight red or brown color streak in her hair. Although it was not lipstick, but her lips had such a natural color that it looked as if it was a lipstick. Her face had the perfect shape. And her skin was glowing. All In all i was astonished for witnessing such a beauty.

Someone from the class said yes its the sixth standard. She came in and All the chatter, gossip, snort, stopped at once and the whole class came to a pin drop silence, except that ceiling fan from the 80's. I sat at my seat. Everyone opened their text book. She asked whats the syllabus for this term. Obviously she was asking from the one responsible for informing all that and that was me. My friend from the right side poked me to stand up and reply. But the hangover of the beauty that was exposed to me was way way stronger to come down from just mere poke. I kept quiet. Somebody from the back answered. I kept quiet the whole time she was there in the class. 

Its been years since that day. I am a graduate now but i still cherish that day. Although i dont have a clear picture of her in my mind. As time went and she got familiar with us and she became even more frank. No doubt being a studious and good student, I became one of her favourite students, I guess so. Because she always asked me about anything going on in my class. But she never explicitly mentioned i was her favourite student because i asked her once and she didn't reply. One day she informed us that she's going to leave the school and today is her last day, because she's going to be married, I still remember that day. I was not supposed to bear that pain at that age, I felt broke. Still somehow I gathered my strength and acted normal. I said "mam, every year i celebrate my birthday on 20th of September, my parents couldn't afford me a gift as we are not that financially good, so i want you to call me every year on 20th september and wish me a Happy birthday and i will consider it the most priceless gift ever. Could you do it?" She replied "ofcourse, I can." And she took my number. I felt good because at least this way i will be in contact with her. It's been more than 8 years since then. She called me once on my birthday surprisingly and wished me. But never after that. And eventually I forgot about it.

 So was it love? Do I used to love her? Well if you ask me then yes, for the first time i had a feeling for someone but then again by the definition given by Bollywood cinemas back then it was not. Because we didn't do any of those things that a couple or lovebirds would do. Though I wanted to, but you know you can't have everything. So what exactly is love, I wondered.

 As they say time is the biggest teacher so do i believe now. Because no one could ever teach me about love, at least not better than time itself.

Love is when a woman who herself couldn't complete her education, sacrifices her happiness just to fund her son's education. Love is when a father who never had a life of his own, works tirelessly just so that his son can have a peaceful sleep. Love is when a brother who when himself couldn't live up to his dream, works tirelessly just so that his younger brother can go for his own. Love is not an act of showing affection but a reaction of emotions being shared from heart to heart. Love cannot be forced, love cannot be purchased, the only way to get and give it is to know the truth, know the emotion. For the love is reality.
